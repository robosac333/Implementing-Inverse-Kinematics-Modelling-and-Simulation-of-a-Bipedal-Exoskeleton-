# Implementing-Inverse-Kinematics-Modelling-and-Simulation-of-a-Bipedal-Exoskeleton

The project involved developing a bipedal exoskeleton using Inverse
kinematics to map the trajectory of human gait in the gazebo
environment. This is a rehabilitation robot intended to confront
mobility challenges arising from conditions such as paralysis,
hemiplegia, cerebral palsy, Rett syndrome, Parkinson's, and more.
Unfortunately, many of these patients find themselves bedridden for a
significant portion of their lives due to the inability to walk.Our
future work will involve adding sufficient control to evolve a
self-balancing robot in a gazebo environment which would further
enhance exoskeleton functionality.
